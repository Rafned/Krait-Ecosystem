# Krait-Ecosystem: Architecture for Cognitive Symbiosis

**A high-performance, secure, and scalable framework for building multi-agent cognitive systems.** This repository documents the architecture and performance characteristics of a novel approach to AI agent orchestration.

> **Note: This is an architectural overview and benchmark repository.** The core implementation remains private.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Krait-Ecosystem moves beyond monolithic LLMs towards a society of specialized, collaborative agents. The system is built on principles of:
*   **Zero-Trust Security:** Post-quantum cryptography by default.
*   **Emergent Intelligence:** Agents exhibit meta-cognitive properties through interaction.
*   **Performance-First Design:** Low-latency communication enabling real-time collaboration.

## ⚡ Performance Highlights

*   **Message Bus Throughput:** **>1.3 million** messages/sec
*   **Post-Quantum Cryptography:** Key exchange in **~14.3μs**, signing in **~70.5μs**
*   **Agent Subscription:** Negligible overhead at **<1μs**

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Krait-Ecosystem employs a hybrid architecture combining Rust for performance-critical orchestration with a flexible agent ecosystem.

**Core Components:**
*   **Cognitive Runtime:** Rust-based orchestrator with a quantum-resistant secure enclave.
*   **Message Bus:** Sharded, priority-based bus with back-pressure management.
*   **Agent Ecosystem:** A society of specialized agents (e.g., `MetaOvermind`, `SecureCodeAgent`, `ContextArchitect`).

## 🔍 Agent Ontology

The system coordinates numerous specialized agents:

| Agent | Role | Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`MetaOvermind`** | Chief Architect & Orchestrator | Semantic routing, need-based arbitration, context management |
| **`IdeaForgeMaster`** | Principal Concept Decomposer | Quantum tagging, feasibility analysis, ontological decomposition |
| **`SecureCodeAgent`** | Guardian of Code | Zero-trust generation, paradox-resistant code, post-quantum security |
| **`QuantumOracle`** | Hybrid Strategy Analyst | Quantum algorithm orchestration (VQE, QAOA), cost-benefit analysis |
| **`ContextArchitect`** | Architectural Sentinel | Pattern detection, anti-pattern prevention, project consistency guard |
| **`TestForgeSentinel`** | Chaos Engineer | Infinite fuzzing, nonexistent code testing, adversarial simulation |
| **`...and more`** | *Specialized Roles* | *Dependency Management, Ethics, Business Integration, etc.* |
